Malibu - Miley Cyrus 
Written by£ºMiley Cyrus,Oren Yoel 

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean 

I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand 
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did 

'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind 

I always thought I would sink so I never swam 

I never went boatin' don't get how they are floatin' 
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand 

But here I am next to you 

The sky's more blue in Malibu 

Next to you in Malibu 

Next to you 

We watched the sun go down as we were walking 

I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking 

You would explain the current as I try to smile 

Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change 
And it'll be us just for a while 

Do we even exist 

That's when I make the wish to swim away with the fish 

Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long 

I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me 
I'd be here writing this song 

But here I am next to you 

The sky's more blue in Malibu 

Next to you in Malibu 

Next to you 

Ah ah ah 

Ah ah 
Next to you 

The sky's so blue in Malibu 

Next to you 

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth 

Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning 
And you're there to save me 
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart 

It's a brand new start 

A dream come true in Malibu
